# Quiz rules

1. Open notes (anything you wrote down)
2. Open course website (lecture slides and lecture code)
3. Limited IDE access (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Notepad, etc.)
    - This is given so that you can see the syntax highlighting in your code, and thatâ€™s it!
    - You may open your IDE but not write any new code
    - You may not compile any code (`javac`)
    - You may not run anything in your IDE
4. No websites other than [course website](https://comp210ss2.github.io), [course Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/797701), and [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/comp210ss2) (for [lecture_code](https://github.com/comp210ss2/lecture_code) and your own exercise code)
    - No Piazza, Canvas, email
5. No phones, even if you forgot your laptop
6. No collaboration except with me, and only for clarifying questions
