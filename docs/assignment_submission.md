## How to submit assignments

1. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository. You can do so in IntelliJ. At the top, click Git > Commit. Make sure the files you want to commit are checked. Add a commit message and click "Commit and Push". Alternatively, if you don't want to push yet, you can just click "Commit" and click Git > Push later.
2. Go to our [Gradescope course](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/797701).
3. Click the assignment you want to submit.
4. Select "GitHub" as the submission method.
5. If you see the "Connect to GitHub" button (because your Gradescope account has not been linked to your GitHub account yet), click it and sign in to GitHub. Then click the green "Authorize gradescope" button.
6. Click the repository dropdown and select or search for your assignment repository. The submitted branch is `main` by default, but if you created a different branch, you can change that here.
7. Click "Upload".
8. Your assignment will be automatically graded, and you will receive feedback very shortly.

For all assignments, you may submit as many times as you like up until the (late) due date. By default, your most recent submission's grade will be your grade for the assignment.
