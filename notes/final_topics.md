# Final exam topics

The final is allocated 3 hours, but I have written it so that it should take less time than that (since we have had some longer quizzes).

The question names are

1. Binary Trees
2. Graph Traversals
3. Min-heap
4. AVL Trees
5. Graph Concepts
6. Big-O Code Analysis
7. Identification
    - Given a picture, identify what data structure it could represent
8. Supporting Data Structures
    - For some algorithms we've studied, which data structures are used to implement them
9. Design
10. Another Design

The design questions are similar to the last question of QZ06.
