# QZ01 topics

1. L3 - OOP
    - Classes/objects (`this`)
    - Encapsulation
    - Interface
    - Concrete implementations of interface
2. L4 - ADT
    - Interface
    - Axiomatic specification
        - Guttag's method (the steps for specifying an ADT, outlined in the slides)
        - Functional specification
        - Canonical / non-canonical operations
        - Given the axioms for a `MultiSet` (i.e., I will provide the specification), be able to apply the rules to a multiset given in axiomatic notation, and be able to write the result in axiomatic notation.
            - E.g., may be given `val ms = add(add(New, 1), 2)`. After being asked the output of `rem(ms, 1)`, you should be able to answer `add(New, 2)` (NOT `{2}`).
3. L5 - Big O
    - Everything on slides is fair game
    - Remember to practice big O questions on [Prof. Stotts' COMP 210 website](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP410-f20/)
        - Click on [exam info](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP410-f20/examinfo.html)
        - Find what is relevant in our class so far and do that. May ignore the rest for now (or study it, may come up later).
4. L6 - List
   - Fair game, but less emphasis, and very likely (a) simple question(s).
5. "Cumulative" in that I won't explicitly quiz on topics from previous lectures, but I may expect you to recall basic concepts such as `public` and `private`.
