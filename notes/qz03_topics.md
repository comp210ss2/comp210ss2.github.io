# QZ03 topics

1. L9 - Trees
    - Understand tree terminology
        - Parent
        - Child
        - Arity
        - Height
            - Min number of nodes in BT of height h
            - Max number of nodes in BT of height h
        - Root
        - Leaf
        - Node
        - Edge
        - Path
        - Depth
        - Traversal
            - Depth-first
                - Pre-order
                - In-order
                - Post-order
            - Breadth-first
            - Be able to determine a traversal given a tree
            - Know how to implement depth-first/breadth-first, be able to recognize code for it
            - Understand how traversals relate to recursive function calls
2. L10 - BST
    - BST definition, invariants
    - BST code structure
    - BST subset of BT
    - #nodes and height of perfect tree
    - BST operations
        - Be able to do this by hand
        - contains
        - insert
            - Each inserted element becomes a leaf
            - Does insertion order matter?
        - remove
            - For simple cases or the 2-children case
        - findMin/findMax
    - In-order traversal creates sorted sequence
    - Given two BST's with same elements (but not structure), which traversal(s) will result in the same sequence?
3. L11 - BST, cont.
    - BST sort
    - TBD
4. EX05
    - May ask a question about EX05
5. Cumulative in that I expect you to remember basic concepts
