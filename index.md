# COMP 210

[The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu), Summer Session 2, 2024

**Instructor**: [Jesse Wei](https://jessewei.dev)

**Time**: MoTuWeThFr 1:15 PM - 2:45 PM

**Dates**: FDOC: 6/24/24; LDOC: 7/25/24

**Location**: Sitterson Hall FB007

**Course description**: This course will teach you how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and large data instances. Rather than learning to use the data structures found in the libraries of programming languages, you will be learning how those libraries are constructed, and why the items that are included in them are there (and why some are excluded).

**Instructor contact**: The best way to reach me is by making a public or private post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/unc/summer2024/comp210/home). Signup instructions are in the [syllabus](syllabus.md#resources).

**Office hours**: MoTuWeThFr 2:45 PM - 3:45 PM, or by appointment

**Acknowledgements**: Huge thanks to [Kaki Ryan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/), [Prof. David Stotts](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/), and [Prof. Ketan Mayer-Patel](https://cs.unc.edu/person/ketan-mayer-patel/) for much of the material used in this course.
